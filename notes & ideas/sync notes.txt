queue_id -> list of song ids

song_id -> song info object



FOR PLAYER CLIENT:

updating would involve:
	get a new copy of the queue list
	if you don't recognize any of the ids
		request their contents
		reorganize (complicated)
	otherwise
		go ahead and move around
	if current


queue destruction would involve
	request that queue_id be destroyed
	which would destroy all entries for song_ids too
